## Setting up VIUSLY: 

If you want to test or use Visuly, there is a setup process, that is rather minimal

In the directors /files, there is a **config_template.json** file. Rename this to **config.json**!

## Config File

Refer to: [Config doc](https://mctomspdo.github.io/Medt_SSProject2022/doc/code/config)
